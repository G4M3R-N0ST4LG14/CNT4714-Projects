### Project 3

The Project3 folder contains the Eclipse project containing every single file used to make the project work. 
The Servlet files are in Project3\src\main\java\project_3
The jsp and html files are in Project3\src\main\webapp
The properties files are in Project3\src\resources
Note that in order for it to work on Eclipse I had to set the server's Tomcat Admin Port to 8081 and the HTTP/1.1 port to 8082.

The webapps folder holds the extracted war file of Project3 and inside holds the Project3 folder which has the class data of the project. The address for the project is:
http://localhost:8080/Project3/authenticate.html
